Would I recommend this book? - Not sure.
But it does give you an impression if you've ever wondered how miserable humanity can be.

What Last Exit to Brooklyn lacks in plot it makes up in characters and misery.
After watching Darren Aronowsky's brilliant interpretation of **Requiem for a dream** it was time to read the original novel written by Hubert Selby Jr (good one).

# A collection of short stories
Last Exit to Brooklyn narrates the tale of a couple "interesting" individuals that face individual hardships and cross paths in their wretched neighbourhood.
Their stories and characters feel unique and real.
Though fortunately 

tainted by poverty, lack of education, sexual phobia and ubiquitous violence.
