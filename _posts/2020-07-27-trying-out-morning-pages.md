I recently learned about "Morning Pages".
The concept is simple:
>
**Handwrite three pages about ANYTHING you like.**
There are no rules what to write about.
You are done as soon as you have three handwritten A4 pages.

The idea seemed like a mix of keeping diary and exercising mindfulness (two activities well known for being beneficial).
One of the testimonies was **"I'm doing it for a long time and people can tell when I missed my pages".**
I wasn't entirely sure about the benefits, but it sounded interesting.

I decided to try it out for 30 days and track my experience in a journal.
The journal will consist of four questions that I'll answer immediately after writing the pages. 
I'll release the **final review in a month**, but I'd like to start by sharing collections of daily logs in frequent intervals.

Let's start with the first three days.

# 15.07.2020
- I feel .. clear and a bit emptied. I had had felt clear before the writing session as well.
	- Can't be too bad to reinforce this feeling though.
- I think .. filling a predetermined set of pages is a good writing exercise. 
	- I reignited the joy of writing just yesterday. This is coming in just in time.
- It took .. ~35 minutes. I think I can manage to write the bulk of the pages on the road.
	- It would be alright to finish at my workplace.
- I want to .. get to work and also write more articles.

# 16.07.2020
- I feel .. good, productive and clear. In particular because of yesterdays experience watching "Your Name"
- I think .. the pages are a kind of diary for me. I recap yesterday, jot thoughts about today and fill the last page with something. I wrote about mental health and habits today.
- It took .. me 30 minutes. I wrote 1,75 pages at home and finished the rest in the bus.
It was a bit bumpy, but alright considering I used the time productively.
- I want to .. work on my company project. I have to work on my masters expose though.

# 17.07.2020
- I feel .. good and I decided to have a day off today.
- I think .. it's fascinating how fun this ritual turned out to be.
	- It's been only 3 days and I'm already sold.
	- Maybe it's just a "beginners enthusiasm", which is the equivalant of going to the gym 5 times a week
	in the first month of signing up.
	- Maybe it's just that, but I'm ready to advertise for it already. That means at least something.
	- And even if I don't feel such strong feelings after a month 
	-> The effects suggests that its essence is healthy and beneficial to you.
	- It's the same thing with the gym: 
	One might not feel the "beginners enthusiasm" anymore, but it doesn't mean that workouts got any less good.
	- It's still healthy as fuck to workout.
	- Humans just tend to mixup what's good for them and what's not.
- It took .. 30 minutes. I even wrote a quarter page more than "I had to".
- I want to .. continue my ritual of morning pages. 
	- I would've written more if it wasn't for the limit. It might be good to have a limit.
	- I wasn't sure about "why 3 pages". 
	- I can already see that 2 pages would be too little to express yourself once you get into the habit.
	- Writing more than 3 pages would be alright as well, but maybe it's helpful to limit yourself,
	because you can get lost in it really easily.
	- Maybe it's exploitable to write really longfold morning pages and feel productive.
	- It of course boosts your productivity and enriches your life quality, but most of us have other responsibilities to do as well (responsibilities we get paid for or that are time sensitive).
