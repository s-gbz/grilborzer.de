Part2

# 18.07.2020
- I feel .. tired. Probably because of yesternights wine. I am motivated to tackle the day though (it's 1 PM LOL).
- I think .. about an idea that came up during the journaling. I will also consider my journaling content.
	- There is no right or wrong to write morning pages, but I noticed a pattern of recaping the day vs expanding on ideas.
	- Both topics matter to me. The number of pages is what limits me.
	I want to finish the day, but I also want to explore ideas I get.
	Right now I'm "mechanicaly" jotting down what comes to mind. That is good.
	- Maybe it could be beneficial to make a (full) stop and reflect once in a while.
	- Maybe I should write the random ideas on the side of the page or capture them on some other media to come back to them later/ directly after.
	- This might be _the_ solution: It would allow gathering multiple ideas, because each would get a little room to be discovered, but not too much as to leave room for others.
		- Each wortwhile thought can later be expanded as much as needed. 
- It took .. 45 minutes today, because I'm a bit tired and had to do some flossing in between.
- I want to .. have some coffee, decide on a draft to finish, clean the house and watch a nice movie afterwards. I'm thinking Akira or Nightcrawler :think:.

- I feel .. tired, because I first spent 2 hours preparing and eating the most perfect pancakes and 2 hours meticulously scrubbing the bathroom afterwards.
(Cleaning the bathroom was _not_ related to my breakfast)
Anyways, the day started well so far!
- I think .. about a recent article topic ("Handling Fight or Flight as a developer") and a little project to catch spelling mistakes in Markdown files.
- It took .. 45 minutes today.
Transitioning onto the third page required a bit of imagination today, but it was worth it.
- I want to .. finish and publish my recent draft on mindfullness today! (Wow, the exclamation mark means I'm serious)

# 20.07.2020
- I ~feel~ .. felt irritable, because I didn't have breakfast at home, started writing in the shaky bus and had to finish writing at my work desk. I was rather easy to set off in the time between.
- I think .. it might be a better idea to dedicate writing time at home, because being stressed to write defeats the purpose.
- It took .. 35 minutes with 30 minutes between the two sessions.
- I want to .. figure out if I was irritable, because I got up at 6 o'clock instead of 7 like yesterday.
