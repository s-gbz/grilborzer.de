Part3
The first two entries are really short.
It's been though two days.
Feel free to skip to the last entry.

**I feel** .. a bit clumsy. My mind is noisy. I feel a tad tangled.
Mein Kopf fühlt sich etwas schwer an. Fühlt sich an wie viel Input. Wenig Worte um das auszudrücken.
**I think** .. I need a nap.
**It took** .. exactly 40 minutes. 
**I want to** .. take a nap.
I also want to get started with my university tasks.

# 23.07.2020
**I feel** .. content.
- I ~think~ .. am planing how to spend the day. 
**It took** .. a bit less than 30 minutes.
**I want to** .. continue todays pages.

**I feel** .. wholesome to have written the pages.
It wasn't as easy as yesterday, but I've reflected on important matters.
**I think** .. about mindsets like stepping up and seeking discomfort.
I have neglected those.
**It took** .. ~35 minutes. 
**I want to** .. commit the actions I wrote about.
Namely acting on my impulses to step up and confront strangers.
I'm bothered when people smoke outside the designated smoking areas at train stations.
I suspect that most people are.
Very few will confront the smokers though.
Confrontatin is something we avoid, because it's uncomfortable.
A lot of things worth doing are uncomfortable though!
Doing those things is a habit and it's a critical one.
Your decision to act impacts your next decision.
Do it more and it gets easier.
Do it less and it gets harder.
It might seem trivial, but remember that it's the little things that shape our life.
[Insert chinese proverb about thoughts, actions, .. destiny]
Pay attention. [Seek discomfort](https://youtube.com/yestheory).
