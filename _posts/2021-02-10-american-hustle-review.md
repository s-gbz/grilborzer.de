Memorable, lively characters, a cast of incredibely talented actors and a plot that's all around the place .. welcome to the American Hustle!

# 3 out of 4 factors great
If I had to summarize my feelings towards American Hustle, I'd start by pointing to a portion of the dialog.
Rosalyn (played by Jennifer Lawrence) has a line in which she explains the smell of her nail polish.

> "There‚Äôs something, the topcoat, (sniffs nails) it's like perfumey **but there's also something rotten?**
 I know that sounds crazy, but **I can't get enough of it**.
> 
> ...
> historically the best perfumes in the world, they're all laced with something nasty and foul. It‚Äôs true!

It's true and it's an analogy:
Not only do I have mixed feelings, but it's precisely those feelings that urge me to write this post.
One could say that the plot of American Hustle is too fast paced and too long (2h 18min).
Cutting 15-20 minutes would be my personal preference.


# Conclusion
Damn, this movie is awesome.

## The movies I choose to write about
Hypothetically, I would love to write about **every movie that I see**.
In reality, I don't.
Mark Manson says that desire is not measured by the mountain view, but by the climb onto it. 
**If you don't want the climb you don't want the hustle.**
You just want the result.
Naturally, this doesn't work out.

So what makes me commit to write?
So far, it's all about movies that **really** stuck, because they moved me in some way.
Whether by being shocking (The Lodge, Black Swan), awfully bad (The Circle), heart melting (Your Name) or debatable (Red Sparrow).
However, this creates **two limitations**:

a.) I naturally want to gift the experience I had to other people (which I can't)

b.) Writing a post about movies leads to a nice collage of fancy thumbnails (which I don't get to see if I don't write)

The solution? A wall of fame!
A virtual trophy room to display my collection of favourite movies, books and albums. 
A visual representation of my hearts contents, open to the world and available at all times.
*You're cordially invited to look around* üåπ.

Thanks for sticking around ‚ù§
