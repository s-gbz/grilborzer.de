**I feel** .. mixed up. I woke up early, almost left the house, but fell asleep before actually leaving.
I arrived at 11 o'clock at in the office.
This is slightly annoying, because I missed 3 hours of potential productivity.
Also, I'm hungry.
**I think** .. I should reconside my sleep schedule.
**It took** .. 40 minutes. I was interruped twice.
**I want to** .. eat some delicious Falaffel and wake up the rational part of my brain.

**I feel** organised and relaxed.
The writing helped me sort out confusing thoughts and schedule my available time.

**I think** that writing daily is an underestimated habit.
I've heard a lot about it, but I had to experience myself in order to truly believe it.

**It took** 30 minutes at most. 
It was exactly as long as my commute.
That was very pleasing.
I feel satisfied and ready to get on with the next task.

**I want to** appreciate and grasp daily opportunities.
I wrote about desires like "meeting spanish speaking people"/ " finding people to talk spanish to" and "instantly talking to woman I find attractive without hesitation".
And you what's funny?
I usually find opportunities the minute I write about these resolutions.
I had just exited the train and finished writing as I saw a couple of (cute) girls passing by.
Guess what, they spoke Spanish.
