Most developers have experienced the struggle of working with a "bad" codebase.
I'd like to share my experience concerning unclear intentions, unmaintainable structures and questionable implementations.
If you currently are faced with questionable code and look for advice, please mind to take my word with a grain of salt.

I've approached the topic from two standpoints:
Handling the situation as someone who's more experienced with the topic and as someone who's not.
Handling the situation as a junior and handling it as a senior.
Depending on your experience

I've found two major viewpoints depending on ones experience.
Approaching the subject as a more or as a less experienced developer.

# Assuming you are rather new to the technology
Sometimes we know that something is wrong without knowing how to do it better.
Facing such a situation might feel uncomfortable or impossible at times.
Remind yourself to take it one step at the time. 
We can draw great benefit if we appreciate the opportunity and don't overestimate the tragedy.
In fact, we can learn how do it the right way immediately.

You will learn how to fix the problems at hand.
You will also learn how to avoid stepping into the same mistakes.

## First: (Festigen) Ground the basics properly
The first step is the most though:
We won't fix anything yet. / There's nothing we can fix yet.
Instead, take a step back.
Study the basics properly!
That might include
- Working through a wholesome tutorial.
- Documenting & sharing your knowledge.

Documenting knowledge can be most 
Expressing/ Reformulating/ .. a topic in own words requires a deep
Being forced to express a topic requires the student to grasp

### Guessing intentions
Do you know the joke that code quality is expressed in "WTF/ per minute"?
A good joke supposedly always contains a grain of truth.
So does this one.
We've all seen code that raised just one question:
"What the fuck?"
Instead we should ask "why the fuck?" and apply the principle of charity.
We probably know what our predecessors tried to accomplish.
"Write a REST controller, unit test a service or do xyz."
They most likely tried their best at it.
However some approaches might be more appropriate than others.
We need to either fullfil their intention or find a better solution.

Guessing intentions is a very valuable skill.
It's essential to understand the problem before attempting to fix it.
