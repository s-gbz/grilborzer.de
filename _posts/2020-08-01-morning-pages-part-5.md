# "Writing daily" - 28.07.2020
**I feel** organised and relaxed.
The writing helped me sort out confusing thoughts and schedule my available time.

**I think** that writing daily is an underestimated habit.
I've heard a lot about it, but I had to experience myself in order to truly believe it.

**It took** 30 minutes at most. 
It was exactly as long as my commute.
That was very pleasing.
I feel satisfied and ready to get on with the next task.

**I want to** appreciate and grasp daily opportunities.
I wrote about desires like "meeting spanish speaking people"/ " finding people to talk spanish to" and "instantly talking to woman I find attractive without hesitation".
And you what's funny?
I usually find opportunities the minute I write about these resolutions.
I had just exited the train and finished writing as I saw a couple of (cute) girls passing by.
Guess what, they spoke Spanish.

# "Writing makes me confident" - 29.07.2020
**I feel** .. better and more confident than I did before the pages.
This is prime example of the magic of writing.


I woke up deprived, blue and joyless.
Naturally, I wrote about those feelings first.



Having realised that, I began to build myself up.
I can't stand putting myself down.
So I build myself up again.

Sometimes we have to tear ourselves down in order to better ourselves.
I can't say that I feel "happy" right now.
But at least I found strength inside me again.

**I think** .. that alcohol is even worse than assumed.
Yesterday was good and productive.
I bought a dry italian red wine and allowed myself two glasses.
The taste was unfortunately just "alright" and **definetly not worth it**.
**Alcohol wrecks your sleep!**

Our body does not get into deep REM sleep allthough we fall asleep faster.
Our sleep is disturbed and we actually wake up most of the time.
We just don't remember, but I know I noticed tonight.

My eyes had a weird sensation of being shut long without actually sleeping.
That sucked!
I won't say that I'm done drinking forever, but I will definetly drink even less than I do already (once per month on average).  

**It took** .. only 30 minutes.
I wrote half a page more, because I couldn't stop myself.
It was really healthy and felt good.

**I want to** .. to be able to work outside and be productive while enjoying the nice summer.

PS: Todays pages gave me a HUGE kick in the butt!
I feel a overwhelming sensation of strength, power and motivation to GO FOR IT.
For what?
Not sure yet, but let's start with a quick session of "polish your house" and follow up by some writing.
And know what?
Maybe I want to be a full time writer.
Maybe that could be a real thing.
I feel very inspired after reading [this interview](https://sitesmonster.com/interviews/tania-rascia-the-secret-is-just-do-a-little-bit-over-a-long-time) with [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/).
