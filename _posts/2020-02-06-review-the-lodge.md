The Lodge offers us what The Shining offered viewers in the 70's:
A fresh take on (psychological) horror.
- Welcome to my **spoiler including review!**

## What I liked about The Lodge
Most of whom saw The Lodge probably saw a number of different horror movies before.
The result is an understanding of established tropes and cliches of the genre, which leads to familiarity.
The result is familiarity.
It's consequence: No fear.

### Understanding audiences expectations
We fear what we don't know.
We're bored by what we do (know). #TODO: FOOTNOTE/TOOLTIP?
We loath what we expect.

You have to understand the struggle here:
There is a fundamental struggle here: 
Viewers want familiarity.
They want things to be as expected.
But this isn't all:
Viewers want to be surprised, to be deceived.

## Playing on audiences expectations
> As a filmmaker you need to understand your audiences expectations in order to subvert them.

The successful execution of this concept is what made me gasp, fear and love The Lodge.
We fear what we don't see and the movies makes sure to give us a hint of everything:

- The vengeful/malicious glare of the portrait -> Did the eyes just move?/ Are the eyes moving ever so slightly? (Is there a demon?)
- The pressing darkness of each corner -> Is something going to jump on us? (Is there a demon?)
- The empty room between the bedrooms -> Is there a hidden family member? Does the family have a dark secret? (Is there a demon?)
- The creature sneaking in the house -> Is it Aidan? Is it Grace? (Is there a demon?)

Not knowing what to expect is what makes us expect everything.
The atmosphere is drenched in tension caused by mystery.

### Implications and consequences
Made me think days after the movie.
The root of the fear is not "How terrible can a mysical creature be?".

> The terror lies in mankind and our capacity to understand each other.
> Our ability to misuse this understanding.
> The question turns from "How terrible can a mysical creature be?" to "How terrible can human beings be to each other?" 
> "What terror lies in the world" to "What terror lies inside of us"

Some of the "fake hallucination/ delusions" that were not explicitly explained

- "Mom <3" appearing on the mirror -> Being a quick, sneaky bastard and a [sociopath](#%22shes-a-psycho%22---the-crow-calls-the-raven-black)
- "REPENT" appearing on the mirror -> Applying razor foam to glass prevents it from sweating
- Angels in the snow -> Having patience after inconspicuously introducing the victim to the symbol 
- The dead can speak -> Hanging yourself and not dying (?) -> No idea how at the moment.

### The first punishment
Though it probably was unintentional: Baiting the victim to break into ice.

This is our first hint how much the kids hate and despise their future stepmom.
Disregarding if it was a plan or an accident:
On purpose or accidentaly
The incident shows that Aidan and Mia wouldn't mind if Grace would be seriously harmed or died.
Neither their fathers possible grief nor his new found love is of importance to them.
All that matters is venging the one who "took away their mother".
The price for that couldn't be too high.

### "She's a psycho!" - The crow calls the raven black
Who else believed that Aidan and Mia were genuinly shocked when their belongings disappeared?
Who else thought that Aidan was genuinly surprised when Grace confronted him about spying on her? 
I couldn't even imagine that a boy of 14(?) years could go to such lengths to torture a person like this.

To quietly observe how a mentaly damaged, traumatized woman crawls circles in a blizzard.
Watch how she loses her dearly loved companion and simultaniously loses grasp to her newly build identity.
How she breaks until she's driven to "repent", torture and mutilate herself.  

You rarely see him display emotions.
Aidan didn't shed a single tear during and after the funeral of their mother.
I assumed his restraint to be based on incapacity and forceful blockage/ resistance. 

It was during Graces self torture that it dawned to me how he could remain so calm and deattached -
> Aidan displays strong indications of psychopathy.

Psychopathic characteristics include
- Capability to remain undistressed in highly stressful situations/ circumstances -> No display of emotion
- No regard for other peoples feelings -> He does care about his sister though
- Ability and will to manipulate people according to his desires

Just in case someone might confuse him as an authist: (#TODO: IN SPOILER BOX)
He can't be authistic, because the authism spectrum syndrome limits patients capabilities to read other peoples emotions.
And he did that.
I'd like to refer to our new [definition of horror](#implications-and-consequences).
He knew exactly what he was doing.

## Sound design
Anyone who ever tried to shoot a movie themselfes will know: 
Sound design is crucial.
Arguably more than all in horror movies.

The score was just like the visuals and the plot:
**Intense**, sinister, huge and haunting.
I can't stress that enough.
It's composed of a huge, bone chilling brass section and tense, cutting strings.

> I never saw a post Credit Roll as stiff and motionless as I did during The Lodge.

#TODO: Include YouTube or Spotify player with soundtrack

It was quite comedial actually:
Three guys sitting in a tiny two row cinema in front of a huge screen.
No one daring to move and interrupt the imposing soundtrack.
A big bravo to the composer .. #TODO!

# Conclusion
The Lodge is a well crafted, well structured movie worth watching.
An instant classic of the "show-this-to-your-friends" kind.
Representative of how horror should be like.

A movie that not only assumes, but finally acknowledges you, the viewer to be smart.
An immersive experience that builds and excells on worn out horror tropes.
Thank you all for making this movie happen - This is what horror should be like!

PS: A great applause to [Joker](../_posts/2020-03-01-joker-review.md) and Joaquin Phoenix for claiming its well deserved Oscar <3!

It's been an hour since I left the cinema.
It's been an hour and my body is stil ripe with tension.
Ready to jump at the next second.
