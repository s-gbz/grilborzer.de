The Lodge offers us what The Shining offered viewers in the 70's:
A fresh take on (psychological) horror.
Welcome to **Why it's awesome! - Spoilers included!**

# Clichés of horror
Most of whom saw The Lodge probably saw a number of different horror movies before.
The result is an understanding of established tropes and cliches of the genre, which leads to familiarity.
To understand why familiarity is a problem in horror we have to understand how we perceive fear.
**We fear what we don't know.**
We're thus bored by clichés and loath predictability.

## Jump Scares vs. atmosphere
What is a natural response to predictable events?
Inserting scary surprises aka "**Jump Scares**".
Jump Scares are a lazy trick though, because they're effective only once.
They induce short lived tension which is directly resolved and expected upon next time.
The real key to effective horror is **atmosphere**.
Atmosphere is great, because it contributes to the whole experience in opposite to a single moment.
Fans of the [Silent Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh6LhkA3698) saga will've experienced this first hand.

# Understanding audiences expectations
Back to The Lodge.
What is it doing right?
We remember that:

- We fear what we don't know.
- We're bored by what is expectable.
- We strive for scary atmosphere.

But here's a new point I hid previously:
We *enjoy* knowing how things go.
We actually like to have a predictable outcome.
The bad guys being gone.
The good guys having won. 
Audiences want to have their cake and eat it.
They want things to be different and familiar at the same time.

You might see a fundamental struggle here.
The solution is **subverting expectations**.

## Playing on audiences expectations
> As a filmmaker you need to understand your audiences expectations in order to subvert them.

The successful execution of this concept is what made me gasp, fear and love The Lodge.
We fear what we don't see and expect *something* to happen.
We do know a lot of clichés after all.
The movies makes sure to give us a hint of everything:

- We see the menacing glare of the Maria portrait and wonder "Did the eyes just move?".
- We move around the house and fear the pressing darkness of each corner thinking "What is going to jump on us?".
- There's an empty room between the bedrooms - 
Do you remember how the door opened itself and you've been waiting to see "something come out of it"?
- Finally there was a creature sneaking in the house at night.
Was it Aidan? Was it Grace? Could there be a demon in the house?

The atmosphere is drenched in questions and mystery.
Not knowing what to expect makes us expect everything.
As my friend eloquently summarized "The tension was topped by even more tension".

### Implications and consequences
The big twist is that the misterious events were staged by the kids.
Love it, hate it, but consider the implication that made me chew on the movie for days:
**How terrible can a person be?**

# The terror of mankind
The ability to feel and share emotions is not a privilege to man alone as it is beneficial to survival of many species.
It is the extension of mankinds reasoning and long term planing that extends this feature into curse and blessing.

Previous generations and horror movies dwelled on the mysteries of the unknown.
The terror of the universe and the idea how scary a mystical creature can be.
Growing up and seeing those terrors on screen for a long time made the mysterie way too familiar though.
The new kind of terror lies in mankind and its capacity to misuse the mutual understanding.
Hugely popular projects like [Get Out](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/) and [Black Mirror](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) seem to support this assumtion.

The definition of horror thus turns from "How terrible can a mystical creature be?" to "**How terrible can human beings be to each other?**". 
From "What terror lies in the world" to "What terror lies inside of us".

## The terrors of Aidan and Mia
Consider this for a moment:
A pair of kids tortured an innocent, traumatized woman until she went crazy.

I'll repeat it again, to let it sink in:
**A pair of kids tortured an innocent, traumatized woman until she went crazy.**

They didn't interve when she finally broke and mutilated herself.   
They let her dog, companion and grasp to sanity willingly die.
They also, but not only:

- Wrote "Mom <3" on the glass and got away by being a quick, sneaky bastard and a [sociopath](#%22shes-a-psycho%22---the-crow-calls-the-raven-black).
- Let "REPENT" appear on a mirror by applying razor foam to glass, because it prevents the covered area from sweating.
- Made a ton of of snow angels after inconspicuously introducing the victim to the meaning of the angels.
- Hung themself to give her the rest. I've no idea how they made this at the moment.

All this while denying her medication.
That cleverly makes her an untrustable narrator and leaves us to wonder what's real.
We as the viewer are lost just like Grace is.

### The ice breaker
Grace breaking into the ice is a foreshadow of the events to come.
It's a demonstration of how much Aidan and Mia hate and despise their future stepmom.
They naturally wouldn't mind if Grace was seriously harmed or died.
All that matters is venging the one who "took away their mother".

# "She's a psycho!" - The crow calls the raven black
Who else believed that Aidan and Mia were genuinly shocked when their belongings disappeared?
Who else thought that Aidan was genuinly surprised when Grace confronted him about spying on her? 
I couldn't even imagine that a boy of 14(?) years could go to such lengths to torture a person like this.

To quietly observe how a mentaly damaged, traumatized woman crawls circles in a blizzard.
Watch how she loses her dearly loved companion and simultaniously loses grasp to her newly build identity.
How she breaks until she's driven to "repent", torture and mutilate herself.  

You rarely see him display emotions.
Aidan didn't shed a single tear during and after the funeral of their mother.
I assumed his restraint to be based on incapacity and forceful blockage/ resistance. 

It was during Graces self torture that it dawned to me how he could remain so calm and deattached -
> Aidan displays strong indications of psychopathy.

Psychopathic characteristics include
- Capability to remain undistressed in highly stressful situations/ circumstances -> No display of emotion
- No regard for other peoples feelings -> He does care about his sister though
- Ability and will to manipulate people according to his desires

Just in case someone might confuse him as an authist: (#TODO: IN SPOILER BOX)
He can't be authistic, because the authism spectrum syndrome limits patients capabilities to read other peoples emotions.
And he did that.
I'd like to refer to our new [definition of horror](#implications-and-consequences).
He knew exactly what he was doing.

## Sound design
Anyone who ever tried to shoot a movie themselfes will know: 
Sound design is crucial.
Arguably most of all in horror movies.

The score was just like the visuals and the plot:
**Intense**, sinister, huge and haunting.
I can't stress that enough.
It's composed of a huge, bone chilling brass section and tense, cutting strings.

> I never saw a post Credit Roll as stiff and motionless as I did during The Lodge.

#TODO: Include YouTube or Spotify player with soundtrack

It was quite comedial actually:
Three guys sitting in a tiny two row cinema in front of a huge screen.
No one daring to move and interrupt the imposing soundtrack.
A big bravo to the composer .. #TODO!

# Conclusion
The Lodge is a well crafted, well structured movie worth watching.
An instant classic of the "show-this-to-your-friends" kind.
It not only assumes, but finally acknowledges you, the viewer to be smart.

The Lodge is an immersive experience that builds and excells on worn out horror tropes.
Thank you to the cast and crew for making this movie happen - This is what horror should be like!

PS: A great applause to the team of [Joker](../_posts/2020-03-01-joker-review.md) and Joaquin Phoenix for claiming its well deserved Oscar <3!
Same goes for Brad Pitt in [Once Upon A Time.. In Hollywood](../_posts/2020-03-01-once-upon-a-time-review.md).

## Fun facts and a comparison to The Shining
- Mention that Grady could be a reference to The Shining
- Mention the different pacings and key points in the movie
  - We start with the kids' perspective and observe Grace as an unperceivable shadow (through window)
- We then switch to Grace as we're in the lodge
- Gradie is Graces symbol of a new life.
His death is the end of her perspective
- We come back to Aidan and Mia.
We learn some of their dirty tricks and witness her final downfall. (In case you didn't notice - the puppet house scenes were the plan)
In a way it's a self fullfilling prophecy as she becomes what they perceived her to be.
Her beauty and gentle soul turn to agony and spreading of pain. 

The Shining is about a mystical, evil force that played on a mentally stressed man untill he broke.
The Lodge is about a *pair of kids* that played on an innocent, traumatized woman untill she broke.
The hotel used spirits and magic.
The kids used lying and intrigue. 
Both of them precisely knew their victims.
