The difference of being overchallenged and too comfortable is easy to miss. 
I decided that things *have* got too comfortable for me.
This has various reasons:
- I discovered a passion for creative endeavors like theatre, singing and [photography](/)
- My learning was focused on classes in university
- Workmatters led me to broadaning my assets in various areas like [Machine Learning](https://github.com/adessoag/facenality) and DevOps

tl;dr [take me to the list](#study-schedule-2020).

## The need to study
Recent events led me to the conclusion that sharpening specific skills is a task for myself.
I also figured that passion drives my work to it's best.
The idea of creating a product that benefits people is emotional investment that I need.

The project has to be managable though - 
Something that takes between one to eight weeks at most.
Delay bears threats of loosing interest and feeling overwhelmed.

> Our assumtion of difficulty scales with the time available ([**SOURCE?!**]()).

Having weekly [personal sprints](https://maketime.blog/article/redesign-your-day-four-lessons-from-the-design-sprint-laboratory/) can ensure motivation and focus on the task.
The following is a compilation of my personal (tech) schedule for 2020.
