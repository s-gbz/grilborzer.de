Time moves fast and technology even faster.
I decided that things got to comfortable.
It's time to sharpen my skills.
Expand my *knowledge* so to say.
![Knowledge meme]()

tl;dr [take me to the list](#study-schedule-2020).

![People learn in many different ways.]()
Personal projects
Side projects worked out best for me.
Having a weekly "personal sprint" can ensure motivation and focus on the task.
Remember that difficulty scales with the time available. 

This is compilation of my personal schedule for 2020.
While my job mostly led me to broadaning my assets (I work at adesso if you wonder)
I figured that sharpening single skills is a task for myself.
Working with AI, Java and DevOps is fun, but I really miss Frontend.
